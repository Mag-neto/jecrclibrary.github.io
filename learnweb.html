		<h1> WEB DEVELOPMENT </h1>
		<p>In today world, everything is sperading across the world and     <br>
		this way to communicate is very fast. In the morden world, web is    <br>
		important tool to share what is in your mind.Some of you want to learn<br>
		it and throught the material available on internet(online course) and<br>
		offline course. We can get a lot of tool to learn the web and Web-   <br>
		Development. But which material suits you ? <br>
		<br>
		That's the thing comes in mind when you want to start to learn the  <br>
		Web-Development. Everybody has his own methods and own comforts.    <br>
		Before two months I don't know anything about the web but now I know<br>
		preety good stuff. So let's check what I got to learn...
		</p>
		<p> To Start learning the web I preferent both online courses and offline<br>
		<br>
		So bascially the Web-Development is divided into three major parts   <br>
		1. HTML ( for built a web page)                                      <br> 
		<!-- can put a wikipedia link that what is html -->          
		2. CSS (to make stylish the web page )                               <br>  
		<!-- wikipedia link --> 
		3. JS ( To dynamically handle the HTML )                             <br>
		here I am going to share the resource which I find helpful for learning<br>
		the web.
		<h2> HTML (what is html click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">here</a>)</h2>
		<p>1. <a href="codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>                          </br>
		This is a great website to learn different web-language like html, css <br>
		jquery, php etc. Throught it HTML is very easy to learn and every tag, <br>
		every attributes, elements are make understandable with the help of the <br>
		proper example. Also it provide you hint if you stuck while practicing  <br>
		</p>
		<p>2. <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly">Dash general assembly</a> </br>
		Same as the codecademy, easy to use interference, proper exaple and though <br>
		good learning practice                                                      <br>
		<br>
		I would like advise here to choose any of one from above two as these provide <br>
		the same course but in the different way.                                     <br>
		</p>
		<p> 3. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> w3schools</a>  <br>
		after competing the course mentioned above you have the basic knowledge about<br>
		what is html, how a web page is maked, you will know some attributes, some <br>
		tags, but this is not enough as the web is too much advanced today.        <br>
		<br>
		So you know that how to use the html tag, attributes and other parts, Now <br>
		go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> to know all the tags, attributes, <br>
		elements. You can try them where you want. It also provide a editior.     <br>
		also go throught the <strong>HTML5</strong> section to get the basic of it        <br>
		<p>
